# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on the initial population of the Memory Bank. This involves analyzing the existing codebase to document the project's purpose, architecture, and technology stack.

## Recent Changes

-   The Memory Bank has been initialized with its core file structure.
-   The codebase has been analyzed to gather context for populating the memory bank.
-   `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` have been updated with initial documentation.

## Next Steps

-   Complete the initial population of the Memory Bank by updating `progress.md`.
-   Begin work on a specific development task, such as adding a new indicator, improving the reporting, or implementing a new strategy.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   The documentation should be kept up-to-date as the project evolves. Any significant changes to the architecture, dependencies, or strategy logic should be reflected in the Memory Bank.
