# Progress

## What Works

-   The core backtesting framework is in place and functional.
-   The system can load historical data, execute a DCA strategy, and generate basic performance metrics.
-   Configuration of the backtest and strategy is possible through `config.json`.
-   The Memory Bank has been initialized and populated with initial documentation.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Enhanced Reporting:** The current reporting is functional but could be improved with more detailed analytics and visualizations (e.g., QuantStats integration).
-   **Strategy Extensibility:** While the DCA strategy is implemented, the framework could be made more generic to support the easy addition of other strategy types.
-   **Data Management:** The current data loading is file-based. A more robust data management solution could be implemented to handle larger datasets and different data sources.
-   **Unit and Integration Tests:** The project currently lacks a comprehensive test suite.

## Current Status

The project is in a functional state, with a solid foundation for further development. The Memory Bank is now up-to-date with the current state of the codebase.

## Known Issues

-   There are no known critical issues at this time.
