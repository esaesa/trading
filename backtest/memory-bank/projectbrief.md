# Project Brief

This project provides a configurable and extensible framework for backtesting quantitative trading strategies, specifically focusing on Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). The system is designed to run simulations against historical market data to evaluate the performance and risk profile of different strategy configurations before live deployment.

The core goal is to offer a robust tool for traders and developers to test, optimize, and validate their trading ideas in a simulated environment.
