# Product Context

## Problem Solved

Developing and deploying algorithmic trading strategies involves significant risk. Without proper testing, a flawed strategy can lead to substantial financial losses. This project addresses this problem by providing a simulated environment where traders can rigorously test their strategies against historical data. This allows for the identification of flaws, optimization of parameters, and a clear understanding of a strategy's potential performance before any real capital is at risk.

## How It Works

The system operates by replaying historical market data (candlesticks) and executing a predefined trading strategy (DCA) against this data. It simulates trade entries, exits, and position management based on the strategy's logic and configuration. At the end of the simulation, it generates detailed performance reports and visualizations to help users analyze the results.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Configurability:** Users should be able to easily configure all aspects of the backtest, from the trading symbol and timeframe to the specific parameters of the DCA strategy.
-   **Clarity:** The results should be presented in a clear and understandable format, with both high-level performance metrics and detailed trade logs.
-   **Extensibility:** The framework should be designed in a way that allows for the future addition of new strategies, indicators, and analysis tools.
